A variety of public and private organizations are now taking steps
toward a wider access to data in many countries across the
globe. Automated tools and customization to local standards are
essential for realizing the full potential of the new information
resources. The comprehensive R library for Open Data, coined
[soRvi](http://louhos.github.com/en/index.html) ('turning
machine'), provides programmatic access to hundreds of data resources
in Finland and enables seamless integration of open data streams with
professional data analysis and visualization tools. The toolkit
received a double award in Private Data opening category in the
national Apps4Finland 2011 competition. soRvi is a community-driven
project all the way - we develop and apply analytical tools for new
insights into how the society works. While our focus is on Finnish
open data and tools, we call the open data community to launch a
network of similar initiatives, suited for local standards and needs
and to share the efforts, code, and fun!
