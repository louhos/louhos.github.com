		With open data on governance, economics,
		traffic, geographic information rapidly
		increasing, there is a clear need for free
		and open tools for analyzing it. A variety
		of public and private organizations, such as
		the <a href="http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/node/6567">National
		Land Survey of Finland</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.fi/tup/tilastotietokannat/index_en.html"> Statistics Finland</a>, are taking steps
		towards better access to publicly funded
		data. Making the analytical tools widely
		available and facilitating their use will
		increase the value of the public data
		resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here at Louhos we aim at:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Providing a central hub that facilitates efficient
			access and utilization of public data resources
		</li>
		<li>
			Developing analytical tools and using them for new insights
			into how the society works
		</li>
		<li>
			Actually, we think Simon Rogers said it better we ever
			could, so read the quote on the right

		<p>
			If you asked me what a data scientist was, I would say someone who can
			bridge the raw data and the analysis - and make it accessible. It's a
			democratising role; by bringing the data to the people, you make the
			world just a little bit better

	<h3>Projects</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Louhos</i> is a community-driven collection of open source code and
		tools for open data in Finland. The Louhos repository is hosted
		at <a href="https://github.com/louhos">github</a>.  Contributions to
		facilitate the downloading, preprocessing, analysis, and
		visualization, written in any language, are welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the projects hosted by Louhos is the comprehensive R
		library for Open Data in Finland,
		coined <a href="http://louhos.github.com/sorvi/index.html"><i>soRvi</i></a>
		(Eng. 'turning machine'), which provides programmatic access to
		hundreds of Finnish data
		resources. The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R environment</a>
		enables seamless integration of open data streams from various sources
		with professional data analysis and visualization tools. The toolkit
		received a double award in Private Data opening category in the
		national Apps4Finland 2011 competition
		(<a href="http://apps4finland.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/high-quality-entries-in-the-apps4finland-contest-signal-a-major-leap-in-open-data-applications-in-finland">press

	<h3>Community</h3>
	<p>
		Louhos is a community-driven project all the way. We welcome
		feedback and material from new contributors. While our focus is
		on Finnish open data and tools, we call the open data community
		to launch a network of similar initiatives, suited for local
		standards and needs and to share the efforts, code and fun!
