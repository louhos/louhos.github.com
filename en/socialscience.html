		<p>
		  <strong>Motivation</strong> With open data on
		  governance, economics, demography and other fields
		  relevant to computational social science rapidly
		  increasing, there is a need for new analytical tools
		  to explore this emerging treasure trove for
		  quantitative research. A versatile and
		  decentralized, yet coordinated ecosystem of
		  compatible analytical software packages dedicated to
		  social sciences could revolutionize the field as
		  already happened for biological sciences during the
		  last decade.
		</p>

		<p>
		 <strong>Solution</strong> We propose creating a
		  decentralized analytical software package ecosystem
		  for social and political sciences to support
		  transparent and reproducible analytical workflows
		  from raw data to analysis, statistical testing and
		  visualization. Decentralization will be essential to
		  scale up the efforts and to adjust the tools for
		  local needs that may vary across geographical
		  regions and application problems. Coordination of
		  the efforts will however help to pool resources,
		  building on lessons learned from analogous, wildly
		  successful projects from computational biology such
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>
		  and <a href="http://www.qiime.org">QIIME</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <strong>Next steps</strong> We welcome contributions
		  dedicated to utilization of public data resources in
		  computational social science in the form of software
		  packages in R, Python or other analytical
		  languages. A dedicated website for the project will
		  be opened in close future. Meanwhile, don't hesitate
		  to <a href="http://louhos.github.io/en/contact.html">contact
