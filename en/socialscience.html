		<p>
		  <strong>Motivation</strong> With open data on
		  governance, economics, demography and other fields
		  relevant to computational social science rapidly
		  increasing, there is a need for analytical tools
		  to explore this emerging treasure trove for
		  quantitative research. A versatile and
		  decentralized, yet coordinated ecosystem of
		  analytical software packages dedicated to
		  social sciences could revolutionize the field as
		  already happened for biological sciences during the
		  last decade.
		</p>

		<p>
		 <strong>Solution</strong> We propose creating an
		  ecosystem of computational software for social and
		  political sciences that supports reproducible
		  analytical workflows from raw data to analysis,
		  statistical testing and visualization. The efforts
		  need to be decentralized to scale up the efforts and
		  to adjust the tools for local needs that may vary
		  across geographical regions and application
		  domains. Coordination will, however, help to pool
		  resources and avoid reinventing the wheel. We build
		  on lessons learned from analogous, wildly successful
		  projects in computational biology, including
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>
		  and <a href="http://www.qiime.org">QIIME</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <strong>Next steps</strong> Let us know of your
		  project! Contributions in the form of software packages
		  in R, Python or other analytical languages, dedicated
		  to utilization of public data resources in
		  computational social science are welcome. A
		  new website for the project will be opened
		  soon. We need your support - don't hesitate
		  to <a href="http://louhos.github.io/en/contact.html">contact
		  us</a> to give your feedback or suggestions!
