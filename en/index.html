		With open data on governance, economics,
		traffic, geographic information rapidly
		increasing, there is a clear need for free
		and open tools for analyzing it. Making the analytical tools widely
		available and facilitating their use will
		increase the value of the public data
		resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here at Louhos we aim at:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Providing a central hub that facilitates efficient
			access and utilization of public data resources
		</li>
		<li>
			Developing analytical tools and using them for new insights
			into how the society works
		</li>
		<li>
			Actually, we think Simon Rogers said it better we ever
			could, so read the quote on the right

		<p>
			If you asked me what a data scientist was, I would say someone who can
			bridge the raw data and the analysis - and make it accessible. It's a
			democratising role; by bringing the data to the people, you make the
			world just a little bit better
