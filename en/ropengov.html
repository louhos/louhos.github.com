<strong>
Algorithms for Open Government Data and Computational Social Science
</strong>

<p></p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">

		<p>
		  We have seen an avalanche of open data on
		  governance, economics, demography and other fields
		  relevant to computational social science.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Dedicated analytical tools are urgently needed to
		  take full advantage of these new information
		  resources, including tools to access, clean up and
		  integrate data on government and society as well as
		  new algorithms to better understand and communicate
		  such information in a fully transparent and
		  reproducible manner.
		</p>

		<p>
		  What is needed is a versatile community-driven
		  ecosystem of analytical software packages dedicated
		  to social and political sciences. We have started to
		  collect such software from independent developers
		  within a single umbrella project. Supporting a
		  community of independent developers could
		  revolutionize the field as has already happened for
		  biological sciences during the last decade, and
		  build on lessons learned from analogous projects in
		  computational biology, such
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  For coherence, we are now calling for contributions
		  in the form of R packages. However, if you are
		  writing related software on other languages, we
		  would love to hear about your project. <strong>We
		  need your support</strong> - don't hesitate
		  to <a href="http://louhos.github.io/en/contact.html">contact
		  us</a> to give feedback or suggestions!
		</p>


<!--		  Decentralization is essential to scale up the
		  efforts and to adjust the tools for local needs that
		  may vary across geographical regions and application
		  domains.
