<strong>
Algorithms for Open Government Data and Computational Social Science
</strong>

<p></p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">

		<p>
		  We have seen an avalanche of open data on
		  governance, economics, demography and other fields
		  relevant to computational social science. Dedicated
		  analytical tools are urgently needed to take full
		  advantage of these new information resources,
		  including tools to access, clean up and integrate
		  data on government and society as well as new
		  algorithms to better understand and communicate such
		  information in a fully transparent and reproducible
		  manner.
		</p>

		<p>
		  A versatile community-driven ecosystem of analytical
		  software packages dedicated to social and political
		  sciences can provide a solution. Supporting a
		  community of independent developers could
		  revolutionize the field as has already happened for
		  biological sciences during the last decade, and
		  build on lessons learned from analogous projects in
		  computational biology, such
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  For coherence, <strong>we are calling for
		  contributions in the form of R packages</strong>. We
		  collect computational social science software from
		  independent developers within a single umbrella
		  project. If you are writing related software on
		  other languages than R, we would love to hear about
		  your project. We need your support - don't hesitate
		  to <a href="http://louhos.github.io/en/contact.html">contact
		  us</a> to give feedback or suggestions!
		</p>


<!--		  Decentralization is essential to scale up the
		  efforts and to adjust the tools for local needs that
		  may vary across geographical regions and application
		  domains.
