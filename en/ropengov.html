<strong>
Algorithms for Open Government Data and Computational Social Science
</strong>

<p></p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">

		<p>
		  We have recently seen an avalanche of open data on
		  elections, economics, demography, traffic, and other
		  fields relevant to computational social science.
		  Analytical tools are needed to take full advantage
		  of these new information resources, including tools
		  to access, analyse and communicate such information
		  in a fully transparent and reproducible manner.
		</p>

		<p>
		  A versatile, community-driven ecosystem of
		  analytical software packages dedicated to social and
		  political sciences can provide a
		  solution. This could revolutionize the field as has
		  already happened for biological sciences during the
		  last decade, and build on lessons learned from
		  analogous projects such
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>.
		</p>

		<p>We are now building a community of independent
		  developers around open goverment data
		  analytics. <strong>We are calling for contributions
		  in the form of R packages</strong>. By joining the
		  community you will get added visibility and
		  recognition for your project and an opportunity to
		  share ideas, attract contributors, and pool the
		  efforts with others working on related topics.  If
		  you are writing related software on other languages
		  than R, let us know. Don't hesitate
		  to <a href="http://louhos.github.io/en/contact.html">contact
		  us</a>!
		</p>


<!--		  Decentralization is essential to scale up the
		  efforts and to adjust the tools for local needs that
		  may vary across geographical regions and application
		  domains.
