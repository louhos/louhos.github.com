<strong>
Algorithms for Open Government Data and Computational Social Science
</strong>

<p></p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">

		<p>
		  In the recent years we have seen an avalanche of
		  open data on governance, economics, demography and
		  other fields relevant to computational social
		  science.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Efficient analytical tools are urgently needed to
		  take full advantage of these new information
		  resources, including dedicated tools to access,
		  clean up and integrate data on government and
		  society as well as new algorithms to better
		  understand and communicate complex societal data
		  streams in a fully transparent and reproducible
		  manner.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Hence, we suggest the creation of a versatile
		  community-driven ecosystem of analytical software
		  packages dedicated to social sciences. To advance
		  this goal, we have started to collect computational
		  software dedicated for social and political sciences.
		</p>

		<p>
		  For coherence, we have decided to focus on R
		  packages. Supporting a community of independent
		  developers could revolutionize the field as has
		  already happened for biological sciences during the
		  last decade, and build on lessons learned from
		  analogous projects in computational biology, such
		  as <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>
		  or <a href="http://www.qiime.org">QIIME</a>. However,
		  if you are writing related software on other
		  languages, we would love to hear about your project.
		</p>

		  domains.
